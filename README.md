Web Development Coding Test: Next.js Application with Django API Integration


Objective:
Build a web application using Next.js on the frontend and integrate it with a Django API backend. The application will feature a basic dashboard page with multiple charts (Candlestick, Line Chart, Bar Chart, and Pie Chart), and the data will be retrieved from the backend (it can be hardcoded in the backend).



Task Breakdown:
Frontend: Next.js Application
Create a basic dashboard page that includes four different types of charts:

Candlestick Chart

Line Chart

Bar Chart

Pie Chart

Charts Requirement:

Use a popular charting library such as Chart.js, Rechart, Lightview, or whatever you prefer to implement the charts.

Each chart should render data that comes from the Django API.

Next.js Functionality:

The frontend should fetch the data using Next.js API routes or directly in a React component via a fetch or Axios call.

Display the fetched data dynamically in the charts.

Backend: Django API
Create a simple Django API that provides the data for the charts. The data can be hardcoded for this task.

Define the following API endpoints in Django, each serving data for the respective chart:

/api/candlestick-data/ – Returns JSON data for the Candlestick chart.

/api/line-chart-data/ – Returns JSON data for the Line chart.

/api/bar-chart-data/ – Returns JSON data for the Bar chart.

/api/pie-chart-data/ – Returns JSON data for the Pie chart.

The data returned from these APIs can be hardcoded but should follow the typical structure that the charts expect.



Data Structures:
Candlestick Data:

 {

  "data": [

    {"x": "2023-01-01", "open": 30, "high": 40, "low": 25, "close": 35},

    {"x": "2023-01-02", "open": 35, "high": 45, "low": 30, "close": 40},

    ...

  ]

}





Line Chart Data:

 {

  "labels": ["Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr"],

  "data": [10, 20, 30, 40]

}





Bar Chart Data:

 {

  "labels": ["Product A", "Product B", "Product C"],

  "data": [100, 150, 200]

}





Pie Chart Data:

 {

  "labels": ["Red", "Blue", "Yellow"],

  "data": [300, 50, 100]

}









Evaluation Criteria:
Frontend Implementation (Next.js):

Correct usage of React and Next.js features (e.g., API routes, SSR/SSG if applicable).

Proper integration of charting libraries to display dynamic data.

Fetching data from the Django backend and populating it into the charts.

Clean, modular, and maintainable code.

Backend Implementation (Django API):

Creation of simple and well-structured Django APIs that return hardcoded JSON data.

Correct use of Django REST framework (if used) for building the APIs.

Proper response format and handling of different API requests for each chart type.

Integration:

The frontend should successfully fetch data from the Django backend and display it in the charts.

The API calls should handle errors gracefully (e.g., display an error message on the dashboard if the API fails).

Code Quality:

Clean, readable, and organized code.

Proper use of comments and documentation where necessary.

Adherence to best practices for both Next.js and Django.

UI/UX:

A simple but clean and intuitive dashboard design.

Responsive design (the charts should adjust properly on different screen sizes).

Clear data representation through the charts.





Submission Requirements:
Source Code:

Provide the full source code for both the Next.js frontend and Django backend.

Ensure the project structure is clean and well-organized.

Readme:

Include a README.md file with the following details:

Instructions on how to set up and run the application.

Any libraries or tools used.

Brief explanation of the approach and thought process.





Bonus Points:
Using TypeScript in the Next.js app.

Implementing Docker for easy setup of both the Next.js frontend and Django backend.

Adding basic unit tests or integration tests for the Django API or Next.js components.

Using state management (like Redux) to handle the data in the frontend
